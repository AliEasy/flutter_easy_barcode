# üõ† Build command used
- flutter build apk --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
- flutter build appbundle --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart

- flutter build apk --flavor stage -t lib/main_stage.dart
- flutter build appbundle --flavor stage -t lib/main_stage.dart

- flutter build apk --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
- flutter build appbundle --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart

- flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

### Cleaning :

- No DRY violations. Create utility files to avoid duplicate code.
- Components should follow the single responsibility principle.
- If you have unfinished task, put a `TODO` before commit.
- Methods that are longer than the screen should be refactored into smaller units.


# üßæ Coding Rules

### Naming

| what | how     | etc    |
| :-------- | :------- | :---------- |
| Classes, enums, typedefs | Pascal Case | ProductBloc  |
| Libraries, packages, directories, and source files names | snake_case | product_detail_view  |
| Variables, constants, parameters, and named parameters | camel Case | variants  |

### Cleaning
[Read this article about clean coding in flutter]("https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-best-practices-and-tips-7c2782c9ebb5")
- Create widgets int uikit for common components
- Don't use directly colors or font style, use uikit
- Split widgets into sub Widgets
- Create components package for sub widgets in each features
- Specify types for class member
- Use if condition instead of conditional expression
- Use ?? and ?. operators
    ```
    var result = title ?? "-";
    var result = person?.name ?? "-";
    ```
- User cascade operators
    ```
    // Don't
    var path = Path();
    path.lineTo(0, size.height);
    path.lineTo(size.width, size.height);
    path.lineTo(size.width, 0);
    path.close();

    // Do
    var path = Path()
    ..lineTo(0, size.height)
    ..lineTo(size.width, size.height)
    ..lineTo(size.width, 0)
    ..close();
    ```
- Use Const in Widgets

# ‚õë Code Review

**What Do Code Reviewers Look For?**
- Code reviews should look at:

- Design: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system?
- Functionality: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is the way the code behaves well for its users?
- Complexity: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?
- Tests: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?
- Naming: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?
- Comments: Are the comments clear and useful?
- Style: Does the code follow our style guides?
- Documentation: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?
- How to implement code review?


**According to the above points every merge request (pull request), must meet the check-list for ensuring about any concern maybe happened in the process.**

- check branch is not broken
- check feature is fulfill
- check test-case is passed
- check code style (with lint or manually)
- check readability
- check side-effects
- check consistency with other class/package/module
- check all comments on the merge request
- The reviewer if has any point about the merge request (pull request) leaves a comment on the line.
